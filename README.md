# About
This is a small toy project that I am working on to gain experience with React/JS/Web Stuff. As of right now, it is pretty barebones and ugly. A few statistics are displayed and a graph of the number of positive case increase from the past 30 days are available for the U.S. states.

# Planned Additions
- [ ] Styling to make it less ugly
- [ ] User controlled date range for the graphs
- [ ] More statistics graphed
- [ ] More statistics in general

# Possible Additions
- [ ] Areas outside of the U.S.
- [ ] Map visualization for number of cases around the world
- [ ] Some type of financial visualization (definitely the most wishy-washy idea --- I have no idea what this actually means)
